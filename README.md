# Printing Press Library

The curated collection of CLIs and MCP servers built by the [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press).

Every entry in this library was generated from an API spec, verified through the press's quality gates, and submitted via the `/printing-press publish` skill. They're not wrappers — they have local SQLite sync, offline search, workflow commands, and agent-optimized output.

The printing press generates both CLIs and MCP servers from the same spec. CLIs are the efficiency layer — fewer tokens, composable with pipes, works with any shell-based agent. MCP servers are the discovery layer — show up in Claude Desktop, Cursor, and marketplace listings. Use the CLI to set up auth and explore interactively. Use the MCP to let your AI editor call the API.

## Claude Code Plugin

Skip the manual install. The library ships as a Claude Code plugin with a single skill that discovers, installs, and runs any CLI or MCP server in the collection.

### Install

```
/install mvanhorn/printing-press-library
```

Want to generate your own CLIs from API specs? Install the [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press) plugin too:

```
/install mvanhorn/cli-printing-press
```

### Usage

```
/printing-press-library                          # Browse the full catalog
/printing-press-library sports scores            # Search by topic
/printing-press-library install espn cli         # Install a CLI
/printing-press-library install espn mcp         # Install an MCP server
/printing-press-library espn lakers score        # Run a CLI directly
/printing-press-library lakers score             # Semantic match — finds ESPN, installs if needed, runs it
```

The skill reads the registry, matches your query to the right CLI, handles installation via `go install`, and executes commands with the `--agent` flag for structured output. See the [SKILL.md](skills/printing-press-library/SKILL.md) for the full routing logic.

CLIs are organized by category. Each CLI folder is self-contained — it includes the full source code, the provenance manifest, and the manuscripts (research briefs, shipcheck results, discovery provenance) from the printing run.

## Categories

|----------|---------------|
| `ai` | LLMs, inference, ML, computer vision |
| `auth` | Identity, SSO, user management |
| `cloud` | Compute, DNS, CDN, storage, infrastructure |

| `sales-and-crm` | Pipelines, contacts, deals |
| `social-and-messaging` | Chat, SMS, voice, social, streaming, media |
| `travel` | Flights, hotels, maps, transit |
| `other` | Anything that doesn't fit above |

## What "Endorsed" Means

Every CLI in this library has passed:

1. **Generation** — Built by the CLI Printing Press from an API spec
2. **Validation** — `go build`, `go vet`, `--help`, and `--version` all pass
3. **Provenance** — `.printing-press.json` manifest and `.manuscripts/` artifacts are present

CLIs may be improved after generation (emboss passes, manual refinements). The manuscripts show what was originally generated, and the diff shows what changed.

## Registry

`registry.json` at the repo root is a machine-readable index of all CLIs with MCP metadata:

```json

    {
      "name": "espn-pp-cli",
