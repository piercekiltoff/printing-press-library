# Printing Press Library

The curated collection of CLIs built by the [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press).

Every CLI in this library was generated from an API spec, verified through the press's quality gates, and submitted via the `/printing-press publish` skill. They're not wrappers — they have local SQLite sync, offline search, workflow commands, and agent-optimized output.

## Structure

```
library/
  <category>/
    <cli-name>/
      cmd/
      internal/
      .printing-press.json    # provenance manifest
      .manuscripts/           # research + verification artifacts
        <run-id>/
          research/
          proofs/
      README.md
      go.mod
      ...
```

CLIs are organized by category. Each CLI folder is self-contained — it includes the full source code, the provenance manifest, and the manuscripts (research briefs, shipcheck results) from the printing run.

## Categories

| Category | What goes here |
|----------|---------------|
| `developer-tools` | SCM, CI/CD, feature flags, hosting |
| `monitoring` | Error tracking, APM, alerting, product analytics |

| `devices` | Smart home, wearables, hardware |
| `media-and-entertainment` | Streaming, sports, video, music, content platforms |
| `other` | Anything that doesn't fit above |

## What "Endorsed" Means

Every CLI in this library has passed:

1. **Generation** — Built by the CLI Printing Press from an API spec
2. **Validation** — `go build`, `go vet`, `--help`, and `--version` all pass
3. **Provenance** �� `.printing-press.json` manifest and `.manuscripts/` artifacts are present

CLIs may be improved after generation (emboss passes, manual refinements). The manuscripts show what was originally generated, and the diff shows what changed.

## Registry

`registry.json` at the repo root is a machine-readable index of all CLIs:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "entries": [
    {
      "cli_name": "notion-pp-cli",
      "api_name": "notion",
      "category": "productivity",
      "description": "Notion workspace CLI with offline sync and search",
      "printing_press_version": "0.3.0",
      "published_date": "2026-03-29"
    }
  ]
}
```
