# Printing Press Library

Nothing is more valuable than time and money. In a world of AI agents, that's speed and token spend. A well-designed CLI is muscle memory for an agent: no hunting through docs, no wrong turns, no wasted tokens. The [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press) prints those CLIs. This repo is the catalog of CLIs already printed and ready to install.

24 CLIs across 17 categories. 17 ship a full MCP server. Browse them all at [printingpress.dev](https://printingpress.dev).

Three to try first:

- ESPN (sniffed, no official API). _"Tonight's NBA playoff games with live score, series state, each team's leading scorer's stat line, and any injury or lineup news from the last 24 hours."_ One call.
- flight-goat (Kayak nonstop search plus sniffed Google Flights). _"Non-stop flights over 8 hours from Seattle for 4 people, Dec 24 to Jan 1, cheapest first."_ Two sources, one query.
- linear-pp-cli (50ms against a local SQLite mirror). _"Every blocked issue whose blocker has been stuck for a week."_ Compound queries the Linear API can't answer.

## Release status

The v0.1.0 npm installer and `cli-skills/` direct-install namespace are prepared in this repo, but public use is waiting on three release steps:

1. Merge this work to `main`, so `cli-skills/` exists on the default branch.
2. Publish `@mvanhorn/printing-press` to npm.
3. Make the repo public, or document the private-repo token setup for early users.

While the repo is private, live installer use requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` for catalog and skill fetches, plus private Go module access for `go install`.

## Install a CLI

After v0.1.0 is published, the primary install path is:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install espn
```

That command installs the Go binary and the focused `pp-espn` skill. The npm package is intentionally thin: it reads the live catalog in `registry.json`, resolves the CLI's Go module path, runs `go install`, and installs the matching skill from `cli-skills/pp-<name>`.

Useful commands:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press search sports
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press list
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press update espn
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press uninstall espn --yes
```

## Use the plugin router

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Add it and install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/printing-press-library
/plugin install printing-press-library@printing-press-library
```

The plugin exposes the catalog router skill:

```text
/ppl
```

/ppl handles discovery, routing, and install guidance:

```text
/ppl
/ppl sports scores
/ppl install espn
/ppl espn lakers score
/ppl linear my open issues
```

The plugin intentionally does not install every focused `/pp-*` skill by default. Focused skills live under `cli-skills/` for direct installation, so users can install only the tools they want.

Want to print new CLIs from API specs? Install the Printing Press itself too:

```text
/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/cli-printing-press
/plugin install cli-printing-press@cli-printing-press
```

## Focused skills

When you already know the tool you want, install just that skill:

```bash
npx skills add mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-espn -g
```

Then use the focused slash skill directly:

```text
/pp-espn lakers score
/pp-flightgoat sea to lax dec 24 to jan 1 nonstop
/pp-weather-goat phoenix forecast
```

`/ppl` is the catalog router. Each `/pp-<name>` skill is a focused interface for one CLI.

## Catalog

Tools grouped by category, sourced from [`registry.json`](registry.json). Each row links to the tool source and its focused direct-install skill.

## Binary-only install

If you only want the binary and not the companion skill, install directly with [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/dl/):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/<path>/cmd/<binary>@latest
```

A few worked examples:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/project-management/linear/cmd/linear-pp-cli@latest
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/travel/flightgoat/cmd/flightgoat-pp-cli@latest
```

For the MCP server companion:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add espn-pp-mcp -- espn-pp-mcp
```

If a CLI needs credentials, the focused skill and the per-CLI README document the required environment variables.

Each published tool is self-contained: source code, a local README, a `.printing-press.json` provenance manifest, and the manuscripts from the printing run. `cli-skills/pp-*` is a generated mirror of each library `SKILL.md`, produced by `tools/generate-skills/main.go`. `skills/ppl` is the plugin-facing router skill.

## What endorsed means

Every published tool in this repo has passed:

1. Generation from an API spec or captured interface through the [CLI Printing Press](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press)
2. Validation checks: build, vet, help, version, plus the structural dogfood and runtime verify gates
3. Provenance capture through `.printing-press.json` and `.manuscripts/`

Some tools are refined after generation. The generated artifacts remain in the tool directory so the provenance stays inspectable.
