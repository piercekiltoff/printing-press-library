# Kalshi — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `kalshi-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install kalshi --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `kalshi-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the install step did not put the binary on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for kalshi-pp-cli when an agent needs price-over-time or category-level analytics on Kalshi markets — the public API only returns current prices and flat positions, so historical and aggregated questions require the local snapshot store. Use it for daily portfolio reconciliation, signal discovery via correlation across markets, and safe scripting against read-only API credentials.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.
- **`portfolio attribution`** — See your P&L broken down by market category and series over any time period
- **`markets history`** — Track how market odds moved over time with price progression charts
- **`portfolio winrate`** — Calculate your win/loss ratio, expected value, and ROI across all settled positions
- **`portfolio calendar`** — See upcoming settlements with your positions, expected payouts, and category breakdown
- **`markets movers`** — Find markets with the biggest price swings since your last sync
- **`markets correlate`** — Compare price histories of two markets to discover correlated events
- **`portfolio exposure`** — See your total risk broken down by category, with concentration warnings
- **`portfolio stale`** — Find positions in markets approaching expiry where you haven't acted recently

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Politics-category P&L this quarter

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio attribution --since 2026-01-01 --by category --agent --select 'rows.category,rows.realized_pnl,rows.fills'
```

Realized P&L attributed to Kalshi taxonomy; --select narrows the response to the three fields agents need.

### Track the Fed-cut market on a watchlist

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli watch add KXFEDFUNDS-26FEB && kalshi-pp-cli watch diff --since 24h --agent
```

Add ticker to local watchlist, then ask for the per-ticker delta since yesterday.

### Correlate inflation and rate-cut markets

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli markets correlate KXFEDFUNDS-26FEB KXCPI-26FEB --window 30d --agent
```

Pearson r computed locally over snapshot price series for both markets.

### Safe paper-trading session

```bash
KALSHI_READ_ONLY=1 kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order --ticker KXTEST-2026 --side yes --count 1 --yes-price 50 --action buy --dry-run
```

Both safety floors engaged: client-side read-only lock + dry-run; never reaches the API.

### Movers in sports markets, last 24h

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli markets movers --window 24h --category sports --limit 5 --agent
```

Computes price deltas from market_price_history snapshots; works offline after a sync.

## Auth Setup

Kalshi requires composed RSA-PSS signature auth: a UUID access key id (KALSHI_API_KEY) plus an RSA private key file (KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH or KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY). Kalshi issues two key tiers — read-only and read/write — and the CLI honors KALSHI_READ_ONLY=1 (or --read-only) as a client-side lock that blocks every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE before signing, regardless of which tier is loaded. Write commands run against a read-only key will surface a 403 from Kalshi; pair with --dry-run while debugging.

Run `kalshi-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  kalshi-pp-cli api-keys get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
kalshi-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
kalshi-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
kalshi-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.kalshi-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `KALSHI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `KALSHI_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
kalshi-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
kalshi-pp-cli --profile briefing api-keys get
kalshi-pp-cli profile list --json
kalshi-pp-cli profile show briefing
kalshi-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → show `kalshi-pp-cli --help` output
2. **Starts with `install`** → ends with `mcp` → MCP installation; otherwise → see Prerequisites above
3. **Anything else** → Direct Use (execute as CLI command with `--agent`)
## MCP Server Installation

1. Install the MCP server:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-mcp@latest
   ```
2. Register with Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add kalshi-pp-mcp -- kalshi-pp-mcp
   ```
3. Verify: `claude mcp list`

## Direct Use

1. Check if installed: `which kalshi-pp-cli`
   If not found, offer to install (see Prerequisites at the top of this skill).
2. Match the user query to the best command from the Unique Capabilities and Command Reference above.
3. Execute with the `--agent` flag:
   ```bash
   kalshi-pp-cli <command> [subcommand] [args] --agent
   ```
4. If ambiguous, drill into subcommand help: `kalshi-pp-cli <command> --help`.
