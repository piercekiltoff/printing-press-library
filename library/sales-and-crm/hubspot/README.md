## Install

### Go

```
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/sales-and-crm/hubspot-pp-cli/cmd/hubspot-pp-cli@latest
```

### Binary

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases).

## Authentication

Get a private app access token from your [HubSpot account settings](https://app.hubspot.com/private-apps/):

```bash
# Option 1: environment variable
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pat-na1-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Option 2: store in config file
hubspot-pp-cli auth set-token pat-na1-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can also use `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` as an alternative environment variable.

For self-hosted or EU datacenter instances, override the base URL:

```bash
export HUBSPOT_BASE_URL="https://api.hubapi.eu"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Verify your credentials
hubspot-pp-cli doctor

# 2. Sync CRM data locally for fast offline search
hubspot-pp-cli sync

# 3. See which deals are stuck with no engagement
hubspot-pp-cli deals stale --days 21

# 4. Check pipeline velocity to find bottlenecks
hubspot-pp-cli deals velocity --weeks 12

# 5. Search across all synced objects
hubspot-pp-cli search "acme corp"
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

- **`deals velocity`** - See how fast deals move through each pipeline stage with conversion rates and bottleneck detection.
- **`deals stale`** - Find deals stuck in a stage with no recent engagement before they go cold.
- **`deals coverage`** - Find open deals where associated contacts have no recent engagement.
- **`contacts engagement`** - See engagement frequency and gaps for every contact across calls, emails, meetings, and tasks.
- **`owners workload`** - See which team members are overloaded with open deals, tickets, and overdue tasks before assigning more.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
hubspot-pp-cli contacts

# JSON for scripting and agents
hubspot-pp-cli contacts --json

# Filter to specific fields
hubspot-pp-cli contacts --json --select id,firstname,lastname,email

# CSV for spreadsheets
hubspot-pp-cli deals --csv

# Compact mode for minimal token usage
hubspot-pp-cli deals --compact

# Dry run - show the request without sending
hubspot-pp-cli contacts create --email test@example.com --dry-run

# Agent mode - JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
hubspot-pp-cli deals --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Retryable** - creates return "already exists" on retry, deletes return "already deleted"
- **Confirmable** - `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Piped input** - `echo '{"key":"value"}' | hubspot-pp-cli contacts create --stdin`
- **Cacheable** - GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** - paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add hubspot hubspot-pp-mcp -e HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubspot": {
      "command": "hubspot-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Cookbook

```bash
# Create a contact with full details
hubspot-pp-cli contacts create --email jane@acme.com --firstname Jane --lastname Doe --company "Acme Inc"

# Search for contacts at a company
hubspot-pp-cli contacts search --query "acme"

# Find stale deals older than 3 weeks
hubspot-pp-cli deals stale --days 21 --json

# Analyze pipeline velocity over the last quarter
hubspot-pp-cli deals velocity --weeks 12 --json

# Check engagement coverage on open deals
hubspot-pp-cli deals coverage --pipeline default

# See which owners are overloaded
hubspot-pp-cli owners workload --limit 10

# Score contact engagement over 60 days
hubspot-pp-cli contacts engagement --days 60 --limit 20 --json

# Export all contacts as JSONL for backup
hubspot-pp-cli export contacts --format jsonl --output contacts-backup.jsonl

# Sync then search offline

hubspot-pp-cli associations contacts 12345 companies

# View pipeline stages
hubspot-pp-cli pipelines stages default

# Analytics: group deals by stage
hubspot-pp-cli analytics --type deals --group-by dealstage --limit 10
```

## Health Check

```bash
hubspot-pp-cli doctor
```

```
  OK Config: ok
  FAIL Auth: not configured
  OK API: reachable
  config_path: ~/.config/hubspot-pp-cli/config.json
  base_url: https://api.hubapi.com
  version: 3.0.0
  hint: export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-key>
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/hubspot-pp-cli/config.json`

Environment variables:
- `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` - OAuth2 or private app access token (primary)
- `HUBSPOT_PRIVATE_APP_TOKEN` - Private app token (alternative)
- `HUBSPOT_BASE_URL` - API base URL override (default: `https://api.hubapi.com`)
- `HUBSPOT_CONFIG` - Custom config file path

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `hubspot-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Ensure your token has the required scopes for the operation

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- Use `--rate-limit 5` to cap requests per second
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

**Stale local data**
- Run `hubspot-pp-cli sync --full` for a complete resync
- Use `--data-source live` to bypass local cache
