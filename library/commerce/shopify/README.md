# Shopify CLI

Ecommerce orders, products, customers, inventory, fulfillment orders, and bulk operations via the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

Learn more at [Shopify](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql).

## Install

### Go

```
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/commerce/shopify/cmd/shopify-pp-cli@latest
```

### Binary

Download from [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/shopify-current).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Set Up Credentials
This CLI talks to the Shopify GraphQL API at `https://{shop}/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json`.

Set the endpoint variables for the tenant, workspace, or API version you want this CLI to use:

```bash
export SHOPIFY_SHOP="<your-store>.myshopify.com"
export SHOPIFY_API_VERSION="2026-04"
```

Get your API key from your API provider's developer portal. The key typically looks like a long alphanumeric string.

```bash
export SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<paste-your-key>"
```

You can also persist this in your config file at `~/.config/shopify-pp-cli/config.toml`.

### 3. Verify Setup

```bash
shopify-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration and credentials.

### 4. Try Your First Command

```bash
shopify-pp-cli customers list
```

## Usage

Run `shopify-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### customers

Shopify customers with lifetime order count, lifetime spend, and contact fields.

- **`shopify-pp-cli customers get`** - Get one Shopify customer by GraphQL ID.

### fulfillment-orders

Shopify fulfillment orders for lag, routing, and fulfillment-state analysis.

- **`shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders list`** - List fulfillment orders from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

### inventory-items

Shopify inventory items with tracked status and available quantities by location.

- **`shopify-pp-cli inventory-items get`** - Get one Shopify inventory item by GraphQL ID.
- **`shopify-pp-cli inventory-items list`** - List inventory items from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

### orders

Shopify orders with money totals, financial state, and fulfillment state.

- **`shopify-pp-cli orders get`** - Get one Shopify order by GraphQL ID.

### products

Shopify products with product status, catalog metadata, and a compact variant inventory projection.

- **`shopify-pp-cli products get`** - Get one Shopify product by GraphQL ID.
- **`shopify-pp-cli products list`** - List products from the Shopify Admin GraphQL API.

### bulk-operations

Shopify Admin GraphQL bulk operation helpers.

- **`shopify-pp-cli bulk-operations run-query --query-file <path>`** - Start a bulk export job from a GraphQL query file.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
shopify-pp-cli customers list

# JSON for scripting and agents
shopify-pp-cli customers list --json

# Filter to specific fields
shopify-pp-cli customers list --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
shopify-pp-cli customers list --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
shopify-pp-cli customers list --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-mostly by default** - resource commands are read-only; `bulk-operations run-query` starts a remote bulk export job only when explicitly invoked
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Freshness

This CLI owns bounded freshness for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, covered commands check the local SQLite store before serving results; stale or missing resources trigger a bounded refresh, and refresh failures fall back to the existing local data with a warning. `--data-source local` never refreshes, and `--data-source live` reads the API without mutating the local store.

Set `SHOPIFY_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to disable the pre-read freshness hook while preserving the selected data source.

Covered command paths:
- `shopify-pp-cli customers`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers get`
- `shopify-pp-cli customers list`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders get`
- `shopify-pp-cli fulfillment-orders list`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items get`
- `shopify-pp-cli inventory-items list`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders get`
- `shopify-pp-cli orders list`
- `shopify-pp-cli products`
- `shopify-pp-cli products get`
- `shopify-pp-cli products list`

JSON outputs that use the generated provenance envelope include freshness metadata at `meta.freshness`. This metadata describes the freshness decision for the covered command path; it does not claim full historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

## Runtime Endpoint

This CLI resolves endpoint placeholders at runtime, so one installed binary can target different tenants or API versions without regeneration.

Endpoint environment variables:
- `SHOPIFY_SHOP` resolves `{shop}`
- `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` resolves `{api_version}`

Base URL: `https://{shop}`

GraphQL path: `/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json`

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add shopify shopify-pp-mcp -e SHOPIFY_SHOP=<your-store>.myshopify.com -e SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2026-04 -e SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-key>
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shopify": {
      "command": "shopify-pp-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SHOPIFY_SHOP": "<your-store>.myshopify.com",
        "SHOPIFY_API_VERSION": "2026-04",
        "SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Health Check

```bash
shopify-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration, credentials, and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/shopify-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:
- `SHOPIFY_SHOP`
- `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION`
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`

## Troubleshooting
**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `shopify-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
