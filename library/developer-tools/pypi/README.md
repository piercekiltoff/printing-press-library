# Pypi CLI

PyPI JSON API. Look up Python package metadata, versions, release files,
and vulnerability data. Browse recent updates and newest packages via RSS feeds.
No authentication required — all endpoints are public.

## Install

The recommended path installs both the `pypi-pp-cli` binary and the `pp-pypi` agent skill in one shot:

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install pypi
```

For CLI only (no skill):

```bash
npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install pypi --cli-only
```

### Without Node (Go fallback)

If `npx` isn't available (no Node, offline), install the CLI directly via Go (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/pypi/cmd/pypi-pp-cli@latest
```

This installs the CLI only — no skill.

### Pre-built binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/pypi-current). On macOS, clear the Gatekeeper quarantine: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <binary>`. On Unix, mark it executable: `chmod +x <binary>`.

## Install for Hermes

From the Hermes CLI:

```bash
hermes skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pypi --force
```

Inside a Hermes chat session:

```bash
/skills install mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pypi --force
```

## Install for OpenClaw

Tell your OpenClaw agent (copy this):

```
Install the pp-pypi skill from https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/tree/main/cli-skills/pp-pypi. The skill defines how its required CLI can be installed.
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

See [Install](#install) above.

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
pypi-pp-cli doctor
```

This checks your configuration.

### 3. Try Your First Command

```bash
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages
```

## Usage

Run `pypi-pp-cli --help` for the full command reference and flag list.

## Commands

### pypi

Manage pypi

### rss

RSS feeds for recent updates and newest packages

- **`pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages`** - RSS feed of the newest packages added to PyPI.
- **`pypi-pp-cli rss recent-updates`** - RSS feed of the most recently updated packages on PyPI.

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages

# JSON for scripting and agents
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages --json

# Filter to specific fields
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages --json --select id,name,status

# Dry run — show the request without sending
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
pypi-pp-cli rss newest-packages --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** - never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** - `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** - `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** - `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Read-only by default** - this CLI does not create, update, delete, publish, send, or mutate remote resources
- **Offline-friendly** - sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Agent-safe by default** - no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use with Claude Code

Install the focused skill — it auto-installs the CLI on first invocation:

```bash
npx skills add mvanhorn/printing-press-library/cli-skills/pp-pypi -g
```

Then invoke `/pp-pypi <query>` in Claude Code. The skill is the most efficient path — Claude Code drives the CLI directly without an MCP server in the middle.

<summary>Use as an MCP server in Claude Code (advanced)</summary>

If you'd rather register this CLI as an MCP server in Claude Code, install the MCP binary first:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/pypi/cmd/pypi-pp-mcp@latest
```

Then register it:

```bash
claude mcp add pypi pypi-pp-mcp
```

## Use with Claude Desktop

This CLI ships an [MCPB](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) bundle — Claude Desktop's standard format for one-click MCP extension installs (no JSON config required).

To install:

1. Download the `.mcpb` for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases/tag/pypi-current).
2. Double-click the `.mcpb` file. Claude Desktop opens and walks you through the install.

Requires Claude Desktop 1.0.0 or later. Pre-built bundles ship for macOS Apple Silicon (`darwin-arm64`) and Windows (`amd64`, `arm64`); for other platforms, use the manual config below.

<details>
<summary>Manual JSON config (advanced)</summary>

If you can't use the MCPB bundle (older Claude Desktop, unsupported platform), install the MCP binary and configure it manually.

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/pypi/cmd/pypi-pp-mcp@latest
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pypi": {
      "command": "pypi-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Health Check

```bash
pypi-pp-cli doctor
```

Verifies configuration and connectivity to the API.

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/pypi-pp-cli/config.toml`

## Troubleshooting
**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the `list` command to see available items
