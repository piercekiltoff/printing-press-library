## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
hackernews-pp-cli stories

# JSON for scripting and agents
hackernews-pp-cli stories --json

# Filter to specific fields
hackernews-pp-cli stories --json --select title,url,score

# CSV for spreadsheets
hackernews-pp-cli stories --csv

# Compact mode for minimal token usage
hackernews-pp-cli stories --compact

# Dry run — show the request without sending
hackernews-pp-cli stories --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
hackernews-pp-cli stories --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** — `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select title,url,score` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Confirmable** — `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Cacheable** — GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** — no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** — paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

claude mcp add hackernews hackernews-pp-mcp
```
