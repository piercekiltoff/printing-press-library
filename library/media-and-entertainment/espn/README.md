# ESPN CLI

Live scores, standings, news, and game history across 17 sports from ESPN

## Install

### Go

```
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/other/github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
```

### Binary

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/releases).

## Authentication

The ESPN public API does not require authentication. No API key is needed.

If you need to point at a different ESPN API endpoint (e.g., a proxy or mirror):

```bash
export ESPN_BASE_URL="https://your-proxy.example.com/api"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check that everything is working
espn-pp-cli doctor

# See all live scores across NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL
espn-pp-cli today

# Sync game data locally for offline search
espn-pp-cli sync

# Search your synced data
espn-pp-cli search "Lakers"

# Check a team's win/loss streak
espn-pp-cli streak basketball nba --team LAL
```

## Unique Features

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

- **`today`** -- See all live games across NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL in one command
- **`search`** -- Search your game history by team name, matchup, or venue instantly
- **`sql`** -- Run arbitrary SQL queries against your local sports database
- **`streak`** -- See any team's current win/loss streak computed from game history
- **`rivals`** -- Compare historical matchup records between any two teams

## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
espn-pp-cli scores football nfl

# JSON for scripting and agents
espn-pp-cli scores football nfl --json

# Filter to specific fields
espn-pp-cli scores football nfl --json --select matchup,away_team,home_team

# CSV output
espn-pp-cli standings football nfl --csv

# Compact mode for minimal token usage
espn-pp-cli today --compact

# Dry run — show the request without sending
espn-pp-cli news basketball nba --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
espn-pp-cli today --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** -- never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** -- `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** -- `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** -- `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Confirmable** -- `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Cacheable** -- GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** -- no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set
- **Progress events** -- paginated commands emit NDJSON events to stderr in default mode

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

## Use as MCP Server

This CLI ships a companion MCP server for use with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add espn espn-pp-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "espn": {
      "command": "espn-pp-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

  OK API: reachable
  config_path: ~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml
  base_url: https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports
  version: 0.1.0
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Variable | Description |

| `ESPN_BASE_URL` | Override API base URL (for proxies or self-hosted mirrors) |
| `NO_COLOR` | Disable colored output (standard) |

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- The ESPN public API generally does not require authentication
- Run `espn-pp-cli doctor` to check connectivity

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check that the sport and league names are correct (e.g., `football nfl`, `basketball nba`)
- Use `teams list <sport> <league>` to verify team IDs

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with exponential backoff
- Use `--rate-limit 2` to cap requests per second
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

**No local data errors**
- Run `espn-pp-cli sync` to populate the local database
- Use `--data-source live` to bypass local data and query the API directly
