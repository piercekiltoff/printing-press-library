# Kalshi — Printing Press CLI

Trade prediction markets, track portfolios, and analyze odds on Kalshi from the command line. Covers all 91 Kalshi API endpoints with RSA-PSS signature authentication, a SQLite data layer with full-text search and cursor-based sync across 20,000+ markets, and 9 transcendence commands that require local state no other Kalshi client provides.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this when a user wants to place or analyze trades on Kalshi event contracts, track their position P&L, review settlement calendars, or investigate market activity and cross-market correlations. Use the demo sandbox (`KALSHI_ENV=demo`) when exploring without risking real money.

Don't reach for this when the user wants a read-only market data summary from a random website — Kalshi's API requires an API key and private-key file regardless. Also not for non-Kalshi prediction markets like Polymarket or Manifold; this is Kalshi-specific.

## Unique Capabilities

These aren't available in any other Kalshi tool.

### Portfolio analytics that compound on local state

- **`portfolio attribution [--by category|series|event] [--period 30d]`** — P&L broken down by market category, series, or event over any time window.

  _Turns "did I make money?" into "which categories was I profitable in, and which drained me?" — the actionable version._

- **`portfolio winrate [--by category]`** — Win/loss ratio, expected value, and ROI across all settled positions.

- **`portfolio exposure`** — Concentration risk by category. Surfaces when you're over-weighted in a single event or series.

- **`portfolio calendar`** — Upcoming settlements with your positions, expected payouts, and category breakdown. The only way to know what's about to resolve without clicking through 50 market pages.

- **`portfolio stale [--days N]`** — Positions approaching expiry where you haven't touched them recently. Prompts action before you lose the chance to manage.

### Market intelligence that requires synced history

- **`markets movers`** — Biggest price swings since your last sync. Uses the local history to compute deltas that the API doesn't directly expose.

  _Live opportunity detection. Daily sync + movers becomes a morning scan._

- **`markets heatmap`** — Category-level activity visualization (volume, open interest, average price). Spots hot/cold sectors at a glance.

- **`markets correlate <ticker1> <ticker2>`** — Compares price histories of two markets to surface correlated outcomes. Useful for identifying arbitrage pairs or hedging.

### Operational resilience

- **SQLite sync across 20,000+ markets** with cursor-based pagination — offline analysis works even when Kalshi is rate-limiting.

- **Demo sandbox support** via `KALSHI_ENV=demo` — every command works against `demo-api.kalshi.co`, safe for dev/testing.

- **Batch order operations** (`portfolio batch-create-orders`, `batch-cancel-orders`) — atomic multi-leg trade construction with rollback on partial failure.

## Command Reference

Trading and portfolio:

- `kalshi-pp-cli portfolio` — Current positions

## Recipes

### Morning portfolio scan

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli sync
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio calendar --agent        # what settles this week
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio stale --days 3 --agent  # stale positions
kalshi-pp-cli markets movers --agent            # biggest overnight price swings
```

Sync pulls the latest state, `calendar` surfaces upcoming payouts, `stale` prompts action on positions approaching expiry, `movers` identifies opportunities from overnight activity.

### Preview then place a Yes order

```bash
# Preview — dry-run shows the exact request without placing
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order \
  --ticker INXD-26APR25-B5525 --action buy --side yes \
  --count 10 --yes-price 65 --dry-run

# Place it
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order \
  --ticker INXD-26APR25-B5525 --action buy --side yes \
  --count 10 --yes-price 65 --yes
```

`--dry-run` returns the JSON request body without hitting the exchange. Flip to `--yes` (or omit the prompt flags) to actually execute.

### Win-rate analysis over 30 days

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio attribution --by category --period 30d --agent
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio winrate --by category --agent
```

Attribution shows WHERE P&L came from; winrate shows HOW RELIABLY — paired, they tell you which market categories to keep trading and which to avoid.

### Safe dev on sandbox

```bash
export KALSHI_ENV=demo
kalshi-pp-cli doctor  # verifies against demo-api.kalshi.co
kalshi-pp-cli portfolio create-order --ticker <demo-ticker> --action buy --side yes --count 10 --yes-price 50
```

Every command works against the sandbox. Unset `KALSHI_ENV` (or set to empty) to return to production.

## Auth Setup

Kalshi uses **RSA-PSS signature auth** — API key UUID + private key PEM file, three signed headers per request (`KALSHI-ACCESS-KEY`, `KALSHI-ACCESS-SIGNATURE`, `KALSHI-ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`). Get credentials at [kalshi.com/api](https://kalshi.com/api).

```bash
export KALSHI_API_KEY="your-api-key-uuid"
export KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="~/.kalshi/private_key.pem"
kalshi-pp-cli doctor  # verify
```

Alternatives: `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY` (inline PEM), `KALSHI_BASE_URL` (override), `KALSHI_ENV=demo` (sandbox).

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes` — structured output, no prompts. Also supports `--select <fields>` for cherry-picking, `--dry-run` to preview requests, and `--no-cache` to bypass the 5-minute GET cache.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required (missing or invalid key/PEM) |
| 5 | API error |
| 7 | Rate limited |
| 10 | Config error |

## Installation

### CLI

1. `go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-cli@latest`
2. Set `KALSHI_API_KEY` and `KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (see Auth Setup)
3. `kalshi-pp-cli doctor` to verify

### MCP Server

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/payments/kalshi/cmd/kalshi-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add -e KALSHI_API_KEY=<key> -e KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=<path> kalshi-pp-mcp -- kalshi-pp-mcp
claude mcp list
```

89 MCP tools exposed for agent integration.

## Argument Parsing

Given `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → run `kalshi-pp-cli --help`
2. **`install`** → CLI install; **`install mcp`** → MCP install
3. **Anything else** → check `which kalshi-pp-cli` (offer to install if missing), verify `KALSHI_API_KEY` is set (prompt for setup if not), match the user's intent to a command, run with `--agent` for structured output. Drill into subcommand help if ambiguous.

## Agent Workflow Features

This CLI exposes three shared agent-workflow capabilities patched in from cli-printing-press PR #218.

### Named profiles

Persist a set of flags under a name and reuse them across invocations.

```bash
# Save the current non-default flags as a named profile
kalshi-pp-cli profile save <name>

# Use a profile — overlays its values onto any flag you don't set explicitly
kalshi-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>

# List / inspect / remove
kalshi-pp-cli profile list
kalshi-pp-cli profile show <name>
kalshi-pp-cli profile delete <name> --yes
```

Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.

### --deliver

Route command output to a sink other than stdout. Useful when an agent needs to hand a result to a file, a webhook, or another process without plumbing.

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli <command> --deliver file:/path/to/out.json
kalshi-pp-cli <command> --deliver webhook:https://hooks.example/in
```

File sinks write atomically (tmp + rename). Webhook sinks POST `application/json` (or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact` is set). Unknown schemes produce a structured refusal listing the supported set.

### feedback

Record in-band feedback about this CLI from the agent side of the loop. Local-only by default; safe to call without configuration.

```bash
kalshi-pp-cli feedback "what surprised you or tripped you up"
kalshi-pp-cli feedback list         # show local entries
kalshi-pp-cli feedback clear --yes  # wipe
```

Entries append to `~/.kalshi-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl` as JSON lines. When `KALSHI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `KALSHI_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream (non-blocking — local write always succeeds).
