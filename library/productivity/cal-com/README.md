## Output Formats

```bash
# Human-readable table (default in terminal, JSON when piped)
cal-com-pp-cli bookings

# JSON for scripting and agents
cal-com-pp-cli bookings --json

# Filter to specific fields
cal-com-pp-cli bookings --json --select id,status,start

# CSV for spreadsheets
cal-com-pp-cli event-types --csv

# Compact mode (key fields only, minimal tokens)
cal-com-pp-cli bookings --compact

# Dry run — show the request without sending
cal-com-pp-cli bookings create --dry-run

# Agent mode — JSON + compact + no prompts in one flag
cal-com-pp-cli today --agent
```

## Agent Usage

This CLI is designed for AI agent consumption:

- **Non-interactive** -- never prompts, every input is a flag
- **Pipeable** -- `--json` output to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Filterable** -- `--select id,name` returns only fields you need
- **Previewable** -- `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Confirmable** -- `--yes` for explicit confirmation of destructive actions
- **Cacheable** -- GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Agent-safe by default** -- no colors or formatting unless `--human-friendly` is set

Exit codes: `0` success, `2` usage error, `3` not found, `4` auth error, `5` API error, `7` rate limited, `10` config error.

```

## Health Check

```bash
$ cal-com-pp-cli doctor
  OK Config: ok
  OK Auth: configured
  OK API: reachable
  OK Credentials: valid
  config_path: ~/.config/cal-com-pp-cli/config.toml
  base_url: https://api.cal.com
  auth_source: env:CAL_COM_TOKEN
  version: 1.0.0
```

## Configuration

Config file: `~/.config/cal-com-pp-cli/config.toml`

Environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CAL_COM_TOKEN` | API key (Bearer token) from Cal.com Settings > Developer > API Keys |
| `CAL_COM_BASE_URL` | Override API base URL (default: `https://api.cal.com`). Use for self-hosted instances |
| `CAL_COM_CONFIG` | Override config file path (default: `~/.config/cal-com-pp-cli/config.toml`) |

## Troubleshooting

**Authentication errors (exit code 4)**
- Run `cal-com-pp-cli doctor` to check credentials
- Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $CAL_COM_TOKEN`
- Ensure the key has not expired in Cal.com Settings > Developer > API Keys

**Not found errors (exit code 3)**
- Check the resource ID is correct
- Run the list command to see available items (e.g., `cal-com-pp-cli bookings`)

**Rate limit errors (exit code 7)**
- The CLI auto-retries with adaptive backoff
- Use `--rate-limit 2` to cap requests per second
- If persistent, wait a few minutes and try again

**Sync or search errors**
- Run `cal-com-pp-cli sync --full` to rebuild the local database
- Check disk space at `~/.local/share/cal-com-pp-cli/data.db`
