# Pagliacci Pizza — Printing Press CLI

First and only CLI for the Pagliacci API. Browse menus and slice availability across all Seattle stores, build and price orders, manage your reward card and stored coupons, and replay past orders — all with offline search, agent-native output, and Chrome-cookie login (no manual token paste).

## When to Use This CLI

Use this CLI when an agent or user wants to interact with Pagliacci Pizza programmatically: browsing the menu, finding a store and time slot, building or pricing an order, checking rewards balance, or replaying a past order. The CLI is also the right choice for office-lunch automation (multi-address fan-out) and rewards-aware ordering (discount stacking).

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Local state that compounds

- **`slices today`** — See which Pagliacci slices are available right now at every Seattle store, sorted by proximity to your saved address.

  _When the agent is asked 'what slices can I get tonight?', this returns a single comparable list — no per-store iteration needed._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli slices today --agent
  ```
- **`rewards stack`** — Compute the best application of stored coupons, reward redemption, and account credit for a given order total. Defaults to single-best-coupon + credit; multi-coupon stacking is flagged --experimental.

  _Agents helping with order placement can pick the optimal discount, not just the first valid coupon._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli rewards stack --order-total 45.00 --agent
  ```
- **`orders summary`** — Aggregate order spend over a time range, with top items and store breakdown.

  _Agents helping with budgeting or reimbursement can produce a single roll-up report._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders summary --since 90d --agent
  ```

### Time-aware composed lookups

- **`store tonight`** — List stores that are still open and can deliver to your saved address right now, sorted by ETA.

  _Late-night ordering: the agent only surfaces stores that will actually take the order._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli store tonight --address-label home --agent
  ```
- **`address best-time`** — Resolve a saved address label to the next available delivery slot in one call.

  _Agents scheduling orders for a specific address don't need to discover the delivery zone separately._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address best-time --label home --agent
  ```

### Order workflows

- **`orders reorder`** — Re-create a past order as a fresh cart, with price revalidation since prices change. Add --send to also submit.

  _Agents can replay a routine order without rebuilding the cart line by line._

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders reorder --last --dry-run
  ```

## Freshness Contract

This printed CLI owns bounded freshness only for registered store-backed read command paths. In `--data-source auto` mode, those paths check `sync_state` and may run a bounded refresh before reading local data. `--data-source local` never refreshes. `--data-source live` reads the API and does not mutate the local store. Set `PAGLIACCI_NO_AUTO_REFRESH=1` to skip the freshness hook without changing source selection.

Covered paths:

- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address search`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli credit`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli credit get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli credit list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli credit search`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli customer`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli customer get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli customer list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli customer search`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli gifts`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli gifts get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli gifts list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli gifts search`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders search`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli store`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli store get`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli store list`
- `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli store search`

When JSON output uses the generated provenance envelope, freshness metadata appears at `meta.freshness`. Treat it as current-cache freshness for the covered command path, not a guarantee of complete historical backfill or API-specific enrichment.

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### What can I eat tonight?

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli slices today --json --select store_name,slice_name,price
```

Returns today's available slices across all stores with just the high-gravity fields for fast agent decision making.

### Replay last order

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders reorder --last --dry-run --json
```

Pulls your most recent OrderListItem, transforms it via OrderClone, re-prices it, and returns a sendable cart without submitting.

### Maximize discount before checkout

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli rewards stack --order-total 42.50 --agent
```

Computes the best application of saved coupons, reward redemption, and account credit for a given order total.

### Spend summary for last 90 days

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli orders summary --since 90d --json --select total_spent,top_items,by_store
```

Aggregates local order history into a single roll-up; --select narrows the response to high-gravity fields. (Use --json instead of --agent here: --agent enables --compact, which strips fields before --select can pick them.)

### Delivery time for home address

```bash
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address best-time --label home --agent
```

One-call resolution from saved address label to next available delivery slot for the resolved store.

## Auth Setup

Pagliacci has no public API and uses a custom composed `PagliacciAuth {customerId}|{authToken}` header constructed from cookies. Run `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli auth login --chrome` while logged into pagliacci.com in Chrome — the CLI reads the auth cookies and constructs the header for you. No manual token paste required.

Run `pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs. Pair `--select` with `--json` (not `--agent`) so the compact pass doesn't strip fields before they can be picked:

  ```bash
  pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli address list --json --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `PAGLIACCI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `PAGLIACCI_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli --profile briefing address list
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli profile list --json
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli profile show briefing
pagliacci-pizza-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |
