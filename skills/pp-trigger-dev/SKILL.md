# Trigger.dev - Printing Press CLI

Monitor runs, trigger tasks, manage schedules, and detect failures via the Trigger.dev API. The CLI pairs live API calls with a local SQLite sync so failure analysis and cost breakdowns run fast across large run histories.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this when the user wants:

- list recent runs filtered by status, task, tags, or date range (`runs`)
- find failing tasks or patterns in failures (`failures`, `stale`)
- watch runs live and alert on failures (`watch`)
- dashboard of task health: success rate, duration, cost trends (`health`)
- break down run cost by task, period, or machine type (`costs`)
- inspect queue depth and backlog (`queues`, `batches`)
- audit schedules and deployments (`schedules`, `deployments`)
- list environment variables per project environment (`envvars`)
- search across runs with text + filter (`search`)

Skip it when the user wants to write or deploy Trigger.dev task code; this CLI is read-only for monitoring. Use the official `trigger.dev` CLI (npm) to author tasks.

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** -> show `trigger-dev-pp-cli --help`
2. **Starts with `install`** -> ends with `mcp` -> MCP installation; otherwise -> CLI installation
3. **Anything else** -> Direct Use (map to the best command and run it)

## CLI Installation

1. Check Go is installed: `go version` (requires Go 1.23+).
2. Install:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/trigger-dev/cmd/trigger-dev-pp-cli@latest
   ```

   If `@latest` installs a stale build (Go module proxy cache lag):
   ```bash
   GOPRIVATE='github.com/mvanhorn/*' GOFLAGS=-mod=mod \
     go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/trigger-dev/cmd/trigger-dev-pp-cli@main
   ```
3. Verify: `trigger-dev-pp-cli --version`.
4. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.
5. Auth setup (project-scoped secret key):
   ```bash
   export TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY="tr_dev_..."    # or tr_prod_... for production
   # Alternative (older deployments):
   export TRIGGER_DEV_API_KEY="..."
   ```
   Create a project API key at https://cloud.trigger.dev/projects/<project>/settings/api-keys.
6. Verify: `trigger-dev-pp-cli doctor` reports key status and project identity.

## MCP Server Installation

The CLI ships an MCP server at `trigger-dev-pp-mcp`:

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/developer-tools/trigger-dev/cmd/trigger-dev-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add -e TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY=tr_... trigger-dev-pp-mcp -- trigger-dev-pp-mcp
```

## Direct Use

1. Check installed: `which trigger-dev-pp-cli`. If missing, offer CLI installation.
2. Run `trigger-dev-pp-cli sync` to populate the local store if you'll be running repeated analytics.
3. Discover commands: `trigger-dev-pp-cli --help`; drill into `trigger-dev-pp-cli <cmd> --help`.
4. Execute with `--agent` for structured output:
   ```bash
   trigger-dev-pp-cli <command> [args] --agent
   ```

## Notable Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `runs` | List runs with status / task / tag / date filters |
| `failures` | Failure patterns across tasks and time periods |
| `watch` | Real-time run monitoring with failure alerting |
| `health` | Task health: success rate, duration, cost trends |
| `costs` | Cost breakdown by task, period, machine type |
| `queues` | Queues with running + queued counts |
| `batches` | Batch status and item counts |
| `schedules` | All schedules and their next-run times |
| `deployments` | Most recent deployment info |
| `envvars` | Environment variables per project env |
| `waitpoints` | List waitpoint tokens |
| `search` | Text + filter search across synced data |
| `sync` | Populate local SQLite for offline queries |

Run any command with `--help` for full flag documentation.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields, with dotted-path support (see below)
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Cacheable** — GET responses cached for 5 minutes, bypass with `--no-cache`
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag


### Filtering output

`--select` accepts dotted paths to descend into nested responses; arrays traverse element-wise:

```bash
trigger-dev-pp-cli <command> --agent --select id,name
trigger-dev-pp-cli <command> --agent --select items.id,items.owner.name
```

Use this to narrow huge payloads to the fields you actually need — critical for deeply nested API responses.


### Response envelope

Data-layer commands wrap output in `{"meta": {...}, "results": <data>}`. Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's `live` or local. The `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a TTY; piped/agent consumers see pure JSON on stdout.


## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found (run, task, schedule) |
| 4 | Authentication required (TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY missing or invalid) |
| 5 | API error (Trigger.dev upstream) |
| 7 | Rate limited |
