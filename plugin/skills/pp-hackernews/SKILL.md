# Hacker News — Printing Press CLI

Hacker News from your terminal. Browse, search, and analyze stories with pipe-friendly output. Powered by both the Firebase API (real-time story IDs and threads) and the Algolia Search API (full-text search with filters). No auth required — HN is fully public.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this when a user wants to scan HN without opening the browser, research discussion patterns on a topic, dig into hiring trends, analyze a specific thread, or pipe HN data into downstream tools. Designed for agent consumption: every command emits clean JSON with `--json` and `comments --flat` is meant for piping into an LLM for summarization.

Don't reach for this when the user just wants to read a single story — the HN site itself is faster for that. Reach for this when they want structure, filtering, aggregation, or offline access.

## Unique Capabilities

These commands aren't available in any other HN tool.

### Time-windowed discovery

- **`since <duration> [--sort velocity] [--min-points N]`** — What hit HN while you were away. One command, no setup.

  _Solves the "I was offline for 12 hours, what did I miss" problem without scrolling through 20 pages of the site._

- **`show [--hot] [--since 7d]`** — Show HN sorted by velocity or best-of-week.

- **`ask [--topic <t>] [--unanswered]`** — Ask HN filtered by topic or find questions with no top-level responses.

### Discussion analytics

- **`tldr <story_id>`** — Mechanical thread digest: top takes, most active commenters, controversy score. Not an LLM summary — structured extraction you can pipe into an LLM.

  _Pairs perfectly with `| claude "summarize in 5 bullets"` for agentic thread reading._

- **`controversial [--since 24h] [--min-comments 50]`** — Stories with high comment-to-point ratios. These are the fights, the divisive topics, the stories where people disagree.

- **`pulse <topic>`** — Activity timeline + stats for a topic. "What's HN saying about Rust this week?" → points plot, story count, top voices.

### Hiring intelligence

- **`hiring [regex] [--remote] [--tech] [--salary]`** — Smart "Who is Hiring?" filtering. Accepts a regex as a positional argument for keyword matching (e.g., `hiring "rust"`), then apply boolean filters for remote / tech stack / salary info. Much richer than naive grep.

- **`hiring-stats [--months N]`** — Aggregate hiring data across months: most requested languages, remote percentage, salary ranges, trends over time.

### Utility

- **`repost <url>`** — Check if a URL was posted before (and how it did). Runs the Algolia URL lookup.

- **`my <username>`** — Submission tracking for a user: which posts got traction, best posting times, karma delta.

- **`since` with piped output** — `hackernews-pp-cli stories --json | jq '.results[] | select(.score > 100)'` becomes standard tooling for custom filtering.

## Recipes

### "What did I miss on HN in the last day?"

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli since 24h --min-points 100 --sort velocity --agent
```

Returns stories posted in the last 24 hours with at least 100 points, sorted by how fast they're climbing. One call replaces 20 minutes of scrolling.

### Research a topic's week of activity

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli pulse "AI agents" --agent
hackernews-pp-cli by-date "AI agents" --tags story --agent | jq '.hits[0:5]'
```

`pulse` gives the temporal shape (when did activity spike, who commented most); `by-date` pulls the top 5 matching stories for deeper reading.

### Hiring market intel for remote Rust

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli hiring "rust" --remote --tech --agent
hackernews-pp-cli hiring-stats --months 6 --agent
```

First call lists current-month posts that mention Rust and remote. Second call shows multi-month trends — is Rust growing or cooling on HN, what's the remote share, typical salary bands.

### Summarize a massive discussion thread

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli tldr 38795924 --agent           # structured top takes
hackernews-pp-cli comments 38795924 --flat --agent | claude "summarize in 5 bullets"
```

`tldr` extracts structure (top-voted takes, active commenters, controversy score). The flat comments dump pipes cleanly into an LLM for prose summary.

### Check if your blog post was already shared

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli repost "https://example.com/my-post" --agent
```

Returns any matching submissions — points, date, commenter count. Tells you if it's worth resubmitting (dead thread, low points) or not (already viral once).

## Auth Setup

**None required.** Hacker News APIs (Firebase + Algolia) are fully public. The `auth` subcommand exists for consistency with other Printing Press CLIs but is a no-op here — `doctor` will report "Auth: not required" as a warning, which is expected.

Optional config:
- `HACKERNEWS_CONFIG` — override config file path
- `HACKERNEWS_BASE_URL` — override the Firebase base URL (rarely needed)

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes` — structured, pipe-friendly, no prompts. Use `--select <fields>` to cherry-pick fields for compact agent context, `--dry-run` to preview the API request, `--no-cache` to bypass the 5-minute GET cache.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Not found (story/user/item) |
| 5 | API error (upstream Firebase or Algolia issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited |

## Installation

### CLI

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/hackernews/cmd/hackernews-pp-cli@latest
hackernews-pp-cli doctor  # verifies API reachability
```

### MCP Server

10 public MCP tools exposed (no auth gating — everything works via MCP).

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/hackernews/cmd/hackernews-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add hackernews-pp-mcp -- hackernews-pp-mcp
```

## Argument Parsing

Given `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → run `hackernews-pp-cli --help`
2. **`install`** → CLI install; **`install mcp`** → MCP install
3. **Anything else** → check `which hackernews-pp-cli` (offer install if missing), match user intent to a command (lean on Unique Capabilities for time-windowed or analytical queries; Command Reference for direct lookups), run with `--agent` for structured output.

## Agent Workflow Features

This CLI exposes three shared agent-workflow capabilities patched in from cli-printing-press PR #218.

### Named profiles

Persist a set of flags under a name and reuse them across invocations.

```bash
# Save the current non-default flags as a named profile
hackernews-pp-cli profile save <name>

# Use a profile — overlays its values onto any flag you don't set explicitly
hackernews-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>

# List / inspect / remove
hackernews-pp-cli profile list
hackernews-pp-cli profile show <name>
hackernews-pp-cli profile delete <name> --yes
```

Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.

### --deliver

Route command output to a sink other than stdout. Useful when an agent needs to hand a result to a file, a webhook, or another process without plumbing.

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli <command> --deliver file:/path/to/out.json
hackernews-pp-cli <command> --deliver webhook:https://hooks.example/in
```

File sinks write atomically (tmp + rename). Webhook sinks POST `application/json` (or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact` is set). Unknown schemes produce a structured refusal listing the supported set.

### feedback

Record in-band feedback about this CLI from the agent side of the loop. Local-only by default; safe to call without configuration.

```bash
hackernews-pp-cli feedback "what surprised you or tripped you up"
hackernews-pp-cli feedback list         # show local entries
hackernews-pp-cli feedback clear --yes  # wipe
```

Entries append to `~/.hackernews-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl` as JSON lines. When `HACKERNEWS_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `HACKERNEWS_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream (non-blocking — local write always succeeds).
